## Overview
Our CEO, V. Isualize has assigned us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. He/She also wants us to create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Then we will analyze the differences in the data by city type.

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.0, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Matplotlib 3.4.3

## Results
### Multiple Line Graph

### What The Line Graph Tells Us
Clearly, there is a significant difference between urban, suburban, and rural total fares. The multiple line graph shows that urban has the highest total fares, suburban a clear second, and rural has the lowest total fares. Yet, this does not show the whole story.

### Summary Table

### What The Summary Tells Us
The table shows us that urban is the highest market share, with suburban behind it and rural last. Total rides, total drivers, and total fares all follow this trend. This reaffirms our findings shown in the line graph. The new information this table shows us is that the average fare per ride follows the exact opposite trend, with urban being the lowest, suburban in the middle, and rural the highest. This is likely due to the fact that rural rides are likely to be longer distances than urban rides, where everything is nearby. Average fare per driver follows the same trend as average fare per ride.

## Summary
### Recommendations
My first and foremost recommendation would be to obtain mileage data for the rides. Before making any changes, mileage data must be known. It has possibly the biggest effect on expenses. The cost for the driver of each ride wholely depends on how much gas they use, and their time. Any other recommendations should be taken with a grain of salt. Another recommendation I would make is to see if there is a way to increase rides in the rural and suburban market. That should start with getting more drivers. Until mileage data is obtained, or some sort of measurement of cost to the drivers/the driver's profit, I would not make any more recommendations.
